In the darkest night,
I fell upon the likes
of someone that I used to know.
They held their phone
To their face
So that they seemed some gaunt phantom
Their breath plumed 
As if with each breath 
Fleeting life rose out 
Of them into the twilit 
Technicolor darkness

I closed my eyes,
and opened them again to the emptiness
of a mountain range--
it's yawning vastness swallowing
breath of my body.
