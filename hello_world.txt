What a wonderful day to be learning new things!
I'm starting to think that this software development path is the sort of thing I've been seeking for a long time.
I like how the lines of codes
Often have the aesthetic appeal of poetry,
But they're combined with a machine language, 
a logic that is growing on my mind--
I find that with each passing day,
I find the technicality of it all less
imposing and more revolutionary.
It's not at all THAT complicated--
of course, I'm not coding *really*
just learning new systems and how thingswork that
I hadn't really considered before. 
And if teenagers can do it, and do it well,
then certainly I can do it--
after all, I think my brain is sort of really
well suited for this kind of work.
It seems to fixate and enjoy it very much!
I get that buzzing often, and I find the 
different applications so appealing,
The possibilities are endless!
